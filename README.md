## Nom du projet
CaptainPlanet

## Description
Vous êtes CaptainPlanet, un explorateur spatial tentant de survivre dans l'Univers, et de trouver des planètes propices à la vie.
Attention! Votre chemin sera semé d'embûches, telles que des astéroïdes, des étoiles brûlantes, et autres surprises qu'il vous faudra découvrir par vous-même...
Prêt-e pour l'aventure?

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support et contact
N'hésitez pas à nous envoyer un message via Gitlab, ou un mail en utilisant nos adresses liées. :)
